        <h3 class="timeline-header">Here's a time line of Itachi Uchiha's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When he was four years old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and
              he witnessed first-hand many of the war's casualties
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>At age 6, Itachi enrolled into the Academy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>At age 11, Itachi joined the Anbu as its youngest member</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>At age 12, he was promoted to Anbu Captain</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After the tragic night when Itachi is forced to choose between
              murdering his clan or protecting his village, he runs to join the
              Akatsuki to keep an eye on their actions and protect his little
              brother, Sasuke.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In order to set Sasuke on this road he cast himself as the
              villain, done by allowing Sasuke to find him standing over their
              parents' bodies and using Tsukuyomi to torment him with visions of
              their murders.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It was Sasuke's safety that ultimately convinced Itachi to go
              through with killing the rest of the Uchiha.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept
              himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower
              so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
